First off, what are we even talking about?

In November of last year, I sent this PR; a huge
change which completely changed the structure of the TypeScript codebase.
This was the culmination of many months of work. We talked about much of
this change's effects on our blog, but there's a lot of stuff we didn't
get to talk about, and that's what I'm going to go over today.

# An outline

- What even is a "migration to modules"?
- Why was it so challenging?
- How did we do it, even though it was challenging?
- How did the migration _actually_ work?

---

# What even _are_ modules?

## 

A few different definitions... two most critical are:

- Modules are a _syntax_ (`import`, `export`)
- Modules are an _output format_ (ESM, CommonJS, SystemJS, AMD, UMD, IIFE, ...)

<br>

```ts
// @filename: src/someFile.ts
export function sayHello(name: string) { // Export from one file...
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

// @filename: src/index.ts
import { sayHello } from "./someFile"; // ... import it in another.

sayHello("TypeScript Congress");
```

<!--
When I talk about modules in this talk, I'm primarily talking about
the syntax and its associated layout on disk.

This begs the question; if we're migrating to this, what were we using?

# TypeScript <= 4.9

}

// @filename: src/compiler/program.ts
namespace ts {
    export function createProgram(): Program {
        const sourceFile = createSourceFile(text);
    }
}
```

<v-clicks at="0">

- Code is organized into "namespaces"
- Declarations are exported using `export`
- Other namespaces can reference exported declarations _implicitly_

</v-clicks>

# Namespaces have some upsides

## 

With namespaces, we don't have to write imports, ever! üòÖ

- Everything _feels_ local
- When we write new code, we don't have to add any new imports
- Moving code from one file to another doesn't require modifying imports
- We can "bundle" our code using only `tsc`'s module references and `prepend`
  features

But...

---

# Nobody writes code like this anymore!

- We completely miss out "dogfooding" our own module experience
  - Modern module resolution, auto-imports, import sorting, organization...
- We can't use any tooling that needs imports, or that skips `tsc`

We want to be able to write:

```ts
// @filename: src/compiler/parser.ts
export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): SourceFile {/* ... */}

// @filename: src/compiler/program.ts
import { createSourceFile } from "./parser";

export function createProgram(): Program {
    const sourceFile = createSourceFile(text);
}
```

---

# We know what we want; let's do it

## 

The question is... how can we:

- Actually make the switch ...
- ... while maintaining the same behavior ...
- ... and preserving a compatible API?

_Oh, and also..._

# TS is huge!

<LightOrDark>
<template #dark><TSReleaseByLines theme="dark" /></template>
<template #light><TSReleaseByLines theme="light" /></template>
</LightOrDark>

<!--
This is a over a quarter of a million non-test lines which are
going to have to change.

Oh, and did I mention that there were over 1000 commits to main
in the 9 months from when I started to when I merged the change?

Average of 5 commits a weekday; even one commit would invalidate
the whole thing.

Any solution not only needs to handle the size of the code, but
also make it as easy as possible to apply to main even when it changes.
-->

---

# How can we change a huge, moving project?

## 

Certainly not by hand! We'll **_programmatically_** migrate the codebase.

- Automate as much as possible through **_code transformation_**
- Make the inevitable hand-modifications **_as easy as possible to rebase_**
- Perform the migration in steps, to make debugging and review easier
  - Not to mention so we don't lose our `git` history!

# What does the migration tool look like?

- Code transformation is performed with `ts-morph`
  - An extremely useful TypeScript API wrapper by David Sherret ‚ù§Ô∏è
    ([ts-morph.com](https://ts-morph.com))
- Manual changes are managed by `git` with `.patch` files!
  - Pre / post transformation patches
  - `git format-patch` dumps to disk
  - `git am` applies the patches
  - If a patch fails to apply, `git` pauses for us!
- The tool automates _everything_

Try it out! (Or watch a recording at
[asciinema.org/a/602875](https://asciinema.org/a/602875))

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL jakebailey.dev/talk-ts-congress-2023/demo.sh)"`

<!--
ts-morph is really great for doing TS-to-TS transformation.
When I started, we were using TS's own transformation system for this,
but our stack is much more focused on JS emit, not perfect source preservation.

This genius patching idea came from a former team member, Eli.
-->

---

# Step 1: Unindent

- We're moving all of our code up one block, and so there's one fewer indent!
- Do this early so later changes don't contain whitespace modification
  - Helps `git` track the code, and us review later changes

From:

```ts
namespace ts {
    export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): SourceFile {/* ... */}
}
```

Into:

<!-- dprint-ignore-start -->

```ts
namespace ts {
export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): SourceFile {/* ... */}
}
```

<!-- dprint-ignore-end -->

<!--
This is a silly one, but modules have their code one indent level above namespaces.
If we unindent the code now, then later steps will be easier to review and git will better
track the code through `git blame`.
-->

---

# Step 2: Make namespace accesses explicit

## 

- Namespace accesses are implicit, but imports will be explicit
- Making everything explicit makes later transformation easier

From:

```ts
export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): SourceFile {
    const scanner = createScanner(sourceText);
}
```

Into:

```ts
export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): ts.SourceFile {
    const scanner = ts.createScanner(sourceText);
}
```

<Arrow x1="500" y1="300" x2="470" y2="350" color="orangered" />
<Arrow x1="270" y1="440" x2="245" y2="390" color="orangered" />

<!--
Note the `ts.` at the bottom.

The next step will show why this is helpful.
-->

---

# Step 3: Strip namespaces (the big one!)

## 

Given:

<!-- dprint-ignore-start -->

```ts
namespace ts {
export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): ts.SourceFile {
    const scanner = ts.createScanner(sourceText);
}
}
```

<!-- dprint-ignore-end -->

We'll convert this into:

```ts
import * as ts from "./_namespaces/ts";

export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): ts.SourceFile {
    const scanner = ts.createScanner(sourceText);
}
```

---

# Step 3: Strip namespaces (cont.)

## 

Thanks to the previous step, all this step _appears_ to do is:

- Delete `namespace ts {}`
- Add an import

```diff
-namespace ts {
+import * as ts from "./_namespaces/ts";
+
 export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): ts.SourceFile {
     const scanner = ts.createScanner(sourceText);
 }
-}
```

But, what the heck is this `_namespaces` import?

---

# Introducing... "namespace barrels"

## 

Using reexports, we can build modules whose exports match the API of the old
namespaces.

```ts
// @filename: src/compiler/_namespaces/ts.ts
export * from "../core";
export * from "../corePublic";
export * from "../debug";
// ...

// @filename: src/compiler/checker.ts
import * as ts from "./_namespaces/ts";

// Use `ts` exactly like the old namespace!
const id = ts.factory.createIdentifier("foo");
```

These are often referred to in the JS community as "barrel modules".

For us, these become our namespaces, so let's just call them "namespace
barrels"!

---

# Nested "namespace barrels"

## 

Namespaces can be nested, like:

```ts
// @filename: src/compiler/performance.ts
namespace ts.performance {
    export function mark(label: string) {/* ... */}
}
```

This too can be emulated using reexports:

```ts
// @filename: src/compiler/_namespaces/ts.ts
export * as performance from "./ts.performance";

// @filename: src/compiler/_namespaces/ts.performance.ts;
export * from "../performance";

// @filename: src/compiler/performance.ts
export function mark(label: string) {/* ... */}
```

---

# Merging "namespace barrels"

## 

To emulate project references and `prepend`, we can merge modules!

```ts
// @filename: src/server/_namespaces/ts.ts
export * from "../../compiler/_namespaces/ts";
export * from "../../services/_namespaces/ts";
export * from "../../deprecatedCompat/_namespaces/ts";

// @filename: src/server/project.ts
import * as ts from "./_namespaces/ts";
```

This "namespace barrel" provides a "view" per-project that mimics the `ts`
namespace we _used to_ observe before modules.

---

# Also, this gives us our public API!

## 

Say, `typescript.js`.

```ts
// @filename: src/typescript/_namespaces/ts.ts
export * from "../../compiler/_namespaces/ts";
export * from "../../services/_namespaces/ts";
export * from "../../deprecatedCompat/_namespaces/ts";

// @filename: src/typescript/typescript.ts
import * as ts from "./_namespaces/ts";

export = ts; // <-- This is what API consumers see!
```

---

# Step 4: Convert to named imports

## 

After step 3, we're left with fully qualified imports, like:

```ts
import * as ts from "./_namespaces/ts";

export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): ts.SourceFile {
    const scanner = ts.createScanner(sourceText);
}
```

This step transforms the above into:

```ts
import { createScanner, SourceFile } from "./_namespaces/ts";

export function createSourceFile(sourceText: string): SourceFile {
    const scanner = createScanner(sourceText);
}
```

This is _almost_ our desired code, but still through "namespace barrels".

---

# ... and then draw the rest of the owl

## 

At this point, we're done with the bulk transformation.

As `main` updates, we can rebase and rerun each of these automated steps.

But, there are still lots of fiddly bits left.

}
</style>

---

# Manual changes

## 

- After the automated transform steps, there are _29_ manual changes!
- This is obviously scary; any changes to main could conflict
- But, we are using `git` to manage these!
- If we run the migration, `git` will pause, just like a rebase. Just:
  1. Fix the problem
  1. `git am --continue`
  1. Ask the migration tool to dump the patches

---

# Bundling with `esbuild`

- Our old outputs were a handful of large-ish bundles produced by `outFile`
- Lots of bundlers to choose from; we went with `esbuild`
- Obviously, it's fast. (200 ms to build `tsc.js`)
- Supports scope hoisting, tree shaking, enum inlining, and is pretty easy to
  work with
- We still maintain a mode in our build which uses exclusively `tsc`

---

# Messing with `esbuild`'s output

## 

Before, our output looked like this, giving us both CommonJS and global script
support:

```ts
var ts;
(function(ts) {/* ... */})(ts || (ts = {}));
// ...
(function(ts) {
    // Just in some random file included in the build üôÉ
    if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) module.exports = ts;
})(ts || (ts = {}));
```

`esbuild` equivalent using `--format=iife --global-name=ts --footer="if ..."`:

```ts
var ts = (() => {
    // ...
    return {/* ... */};
})();
if (typeof module !== "undefined" && module.exports) module.exports = ts;
```

---

# `d.ts` bundling

- Along with "bundled" `.js` files, `tsc`'s `outFile` also produced `.d.ts`
  files
  - But now we're using esbuild, which doesn't produce `d.ts` files
- We ended up rolling our own (small, very limited) `d.ts` bundler
- Definitely not for external use; it's very specific to our API

```ts
// Something like...
namespace ts {
    function createSourceFile(): SourceFile;

    namespace server {
        namespace protocol {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
export = ts;
```

---

# Complete build overhaul

## 

- Our old build was handled `gulp`; had gotten somewhat convoluted
- With modules, the build steps are quite different!
- Build completely replaced, reimplemented in an entirely new task runner
  - Plain JS functions with an explicit dependency graph, as parallel as
    possible.
- It's called `hereby`, don't use it, thanks

```ts
export const buildSrc = task({
    name: "build-src",
    description: "Builds the src project (all code)",
    dependencies: [generateDiagnostics],
    run: () => buildProject("src"),
});
```

<!--
Old build had been gulp since 2016, `jake` before that.

Feature complete at ~500 lines of code. Maybe if I had worked on this
months later, I would have tried `wireit`.
 -->

---

# How did it go?

## 

Great! üëç

- Core development loop performance boost
  - New build is faster in general, `esbuild` means we can skip typechecking
- Performance speedup from `esbuild`'s scope hoisting (10-20% or so)
- Package size reduction (63.8 MB -> 37.4 MB)
- Dogfooding!
  - Discovered a few auto-import bugs
  - Started thinking about better import organization and ecosystem integration
